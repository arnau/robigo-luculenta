Situs Luculentus
================

From the Latin ‘luculentus’, meaning ‘bright’, ‘shining’, ‘impressive’,
‘gorgeous’ and ‘situs’, meaning ‘rust’ (the fungus). This is a port of the
proof of concept spectral path tracer [Luculentus][luculentus], to the Rust
programming language, released under the [GNU General Public License][gplv3].

Luculentus traces rays at different wavelengths, giving it the ability
to simulate effects like dispersion and chromatic aberration. It was
written with code clarity as the primary goal; it is not optimised for
speed, although it is multithreaded.
