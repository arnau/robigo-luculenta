Robigo Luculenta
================

From the Latin ‘luculentus’, meaning ‘bright’, ‘shining’, ‘impressive’,
‘gorgeous’ and ‘robigo’, meaning ‘rust’ (on metals, as well as the fungus).
This is a port of the proof of concept spectral path tracer
[Luculentus][luculentus] to the Rust programming language, released under
the [GNU General Public License][gplv3].

Robigo Luculenta traces rays at different wavelengths, giving it the ability
to simulate effects like dispersion and chromatic aberration. It was written
with code clarity as the primary goal; it is not optimised for speed, although
it is multithreaded.
